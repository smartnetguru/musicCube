/**
An object that acts as a virtual interface between musikCore
and an application or plugin.

Task objects, including Player are constructed with
a Functor as an argument. A practical example of the usage:

When a new song starts, Player calls its internal functor's 
OnNewSong() function. This function in return posts an event to 
an event to it's parent frame.

All the functions are optional to override and only exist to provide
an easy means for any type of interface to manage Tasks.
